As per:

Use PascalCase file naming.
ComponentName.vue

Preface base components with a default word like App, Base or V.
BaseTable.vue

Components that are only used once should be prefixed with The:
TheLargeComponent.vue

Always use multi-word names for your components. Prefacing App or The simplifies this but do this for all components. This is to avoid clashes with standard HTML tags which are always a single word.
MainModal.vue instead of Modal.vue 

Child components should include their 
parent name as a prefix. For example if you 
would like a “Photo” component used in the “UserCard” 
you will name it “UserCardPhoto”. 
It’s for better readability since files in a 
folder are usually order alphabetically.

Always use full name instead of abbreviation in the name 
of your components. For example don’t use “UDSettings”, 
use instead “UserDashboardSettings”.
